        <h1>Military Students and the FAFSA</h1>
        <p class="sarah-p">Those students who have served in active duty as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces division and who were discharged under any condition other than dishonorable would be considered a veteran. These students should answer “Yes” to the question on the FAFSA asking if the student is a veteran. Also, the student will need to provide a copy of their DD214 to the Financial Aid Office to verify their veteran status in order to process federal aid.</p>
