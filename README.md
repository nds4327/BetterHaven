# BetterHaven
This is a better version of Lock Haven University's "MyHaven" student scheduling and management Website
Students of LHU often complain about various aspects in the site's layout and functionality, including but not limited to:
  1) Difficult to navigate content and redundant links
  2) A slow and inefficient course search and registration process, which is especially unpleasant during the hectic scheduling season
  3) A lack of aesthethic and crisp site design
  
 My team and I at LHU hope that our prototyped solution offers a blueprint for an overhaul of MyHaven which will better search students and facutly.
