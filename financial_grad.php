        <h1>Graduate Financial Aid Application</h1>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Graduate students who would like financial aid will need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as a graduate student. FAFSA application is completed online at <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa">https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa</a>.</p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Under the student status area of the application, the applicant is asked to answer “At the beginning of the school year, will you be working on a master's or doctorate program?”</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>You should answer "YES" to this question.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "sarah-p">There is a question referring to the degree you are seeking: “Degree or Certificate you will be working on during the upcoming year.”</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>You will answer Graduate or Professional Degree</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "sarah-p">When asked about your grade level:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>You will answer Graduate Student (first year or after first year)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Eligibility</h1>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Each student who has a completed FAFSA on file and is enrolled at LHU will receive a financial aid award letter that lists the aid the student is eligible. The financial aid award can also be viewed in myHaven under Financial Aid/Financial Aid Award. Because graduate students are no longer eligible for federal and state grants, it is typical that your financial aid will only include loans, assistantships, and/or scholarships. </p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">As a Graduate Student, you are eligible for up to $20,500 for one academic year in Unsubsidized Direct Loan funds.</p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">To qualify for Direct Student Loans:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li class = "sarah-li">You must enroll half time (6 credits) or more in a degree-seeking graduate program each term to qualify. Half time for graduate programs is 6 credits per semester at LHU.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">You must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid purposes. For more information about Satisfactory Academic Progress, please review the Satisfactory Academic Progress in the "Financial Aid Overview" tab.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">Your student loans must be in good standing and not in default.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">You must complete a FAFSA for the academic year as a graduate student in which you are applying for the loan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "sarah-p">The first semester a graduate student receives a loan at LHU, he or she must have completed an Entrance Counseling session for LHU and have a current Master Promissory Note (MPN) on file before the funds will process. These steps can be completed at <a href="https://studentloans.gov/">https://studentloans.gov/</a>.</p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">For more information about Direct Stafford Loans, please review the "Types of Loans" tab. For more information about financial aid in the summer, please review the "Summer Financial Aid" tab.</p>

        <h1>Additional Options</h1>
        <p class = "sarah-p">If the Federal Direct Stafford Loan is not enough to cover a student's educational expenses, there is additional funding for which a graduate student can apply.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li class = "sarah-li">Graduate PLUS Loan</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">Alternative Educational Loan (Private Loan Non-Federal Loan)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Regardless of which option the student chooses, each loan application can cover a maximum of two semesters in the academic year, and therefore, the student must complete the application process for each academic year the student is enrolled.</p>
        <h5>Graduate PLUS Loan</h5>
        <p class = "sarah-p">The Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan is a fixed interest loan program that enables graduate students to borrow directly from the U.S. Department of Education to help pay for their educational expenses. With a Grad PLUS Loan you may borrow up to the full cost of attendance less other financial aid. The Graduate PLUS Loan is credit based and requires credit approval. Credit approval is valid for 90 days. Your credit is evaluated every time you request a new loan unless you have had a credit decision within the preceding 90 days.</p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">The PLUS loan has many benefits such as a fixed interest rate, high credit approval rate and streamlined application process. Loan payments can be deferred while in school at least half time and the loan has flexible repayment options. As part of the Federal Direct Loan Program, this loan would also conveniently become part of your loan account that contains your Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan(s), thus reducing your number of lenders.</p>
        <p class = "sarah-p">To receive a Graduate PLUS Loan the student must:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li class = "sarah-li">Have a complete FAFSA on file for the appropriate year.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">Submit a PLUS application in the student's name at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/plus-app/grad/landing">https://studentaid.gov/plus-app/grad/landing</a> for the period of time the student expects to receive the loan, not to exceed two semesters.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">Be approved to receive the loan. After the application is submitted, the student will receive an immediate response as to whether or not they have been approved.</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">If approved, the student will need to complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and Entrance Counseling for the Graduate PLUS Loan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "sarah-p">It is important to complete all of these required steps, or the loan will not process. Normal processing timeframes for PLUS loans is approximately 2-3 weeks.</p>

        <h1>Alternative Educational Loan</h1>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Alternative Loans are not a government program and are available through private lenders. It is important to research federal loan programs and scholarship opportunities before you borrow from a private loan program. The terms and conditions of federal loans may be more favorable than the provisions of private, non-federal student loans. Student Alternative Loan borrowers are typically required to apply along with a creditworthy co-signer. Interest rates and terms of these loans vary depending on the loan program the student wishes to utilize. Typical processing timeframes for alternative loans are 5-6 weeks. Students are urged to apply as soon as possible.</p>

        <h1>Physician Assistant Graduate Students</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class = "sarah-p">The physician assistant program is a 24 month program with continuous enrollment throughout the duration of the program. A new class of students begins each May. Students who begin the program in May of 2017 will graduate in May of 2019. While in the PA program, a student who wishes to receive financial aid should only need to file two FAFSA applications (details below).</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li class = "sarah-li">The first FAFSA submitted covers two academic years of the PA program. It covers the summer-fall (year 1) and the spring-summer (year 2).</li>
            <li class = "sarah-li">The second FAFSA submitted covers the final fall-spring semesters (year 3).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Direct PLUS Loans for Physician Assistant Students</h1>
        <p class = "sarah-p">Because the program is actually three academic years that only spans 2 years of time, applying for a PLUS loan can be confusing. Use the guidelines below when submitting a PLUS loan application.</p>

            <li class = "sarah-li">First Year/ Summer-Fall: Students starting in the summer of 2018 would submit a PLUS loan under the 2018-2019 year and enter the dates of May-December.</li>
